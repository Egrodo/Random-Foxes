This is a site that will generate random fox pictures off of https://reddit.com/r/foxes. I made this to get more comfortable with React and learn more advanced Javascript, and also because my girlfriend loves foxes. I'm using [snoowrap](https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/snoowrap) as a wrapper for the Reddit API. I'm also using the local storage to enable persistence in caching so that the user never sees the same group of foxes twice. On the first page visit I load 25 posts from the top of the subreddit. From there I filter them down to only accessable pictures and display those randomly. Then, after those first 25 are exhausted, I load another 25. I also have a click-limiter in place so that it's not abusable to flood the API.

You can see it by going to the Github Page here: https://egrodo.github.io/Random-Foxes/. It is easily modifyable to be able to generate random pics from any Subreddit just by changing the sub on line 29 and the flair of the posts on line 34. In a later iteration I might modify it such that those values are changable via the UI when you first visit the site.
